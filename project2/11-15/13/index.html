            Ah, ah,
            cries the crow arching toward the heavy sky over the marina.<br>
            Lands on the crown of the palm tree.
        <br>
        <br>
            Ah, ah,
            slaps the urgent cove of ocean swimming through the slips.<br>
            We carry canoes to the edge of the salt.
        <br>
        <br>
            Ah, ah,
            groans the crew with the weight, the winds cutting skin.<br>
            We claim our seats. Pelicans perch in the draft for fish.
        <br>
        <br>
            Ah, ah,
            beats our lungs and we are racing into the waves.<br>
            Though there are worlds below us and above us, we are straight ahead.
        <br>
        <br>
            Ah, ah,
            tattoos the engines of your plane against the skyâ€”away from these waters.<br>
            Each paddle stroke follows the curve from reach to loss.
        <br>
        <br>
            Ah, ah,
            calls the sun from a fishing boat with a pale, yellow sail.<br>
            We fly by on our return, over the net of eternity thrown out for stars.
        <br>
        <br>
            Ah, ah,
            scrapes the hull of my soul.
        <br>
        <br>
            Ah, ah.
