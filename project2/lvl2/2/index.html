                <h1>
                    Ah, ah,
                </h1>

                <li>
                    cries the crow arching toward the heavy sky over the marina.<br>
                    Lands on the crown of the palm tree.
                </li>
        <br>
                <li>
                    slaps the urgent cove of ocean swimming through the slips.<br>
                    We carry canoes to the edge of the salt.
                </li>
        <br>      
                <li>
                    groans the crew with the weight, the winds cutting skin.<br>
                    We claim our seats. Pelicans perch in the draft for fish.
                </li>
        <br>
                <li>
                beats our lungs and we are racing into the waves.<br>
                Though there are worlds below us and above us, we are straight ahead.
                </li>
        <br>
                
                <li>
                    tattoos the engines of your plane against the skyâ€”away from these waters.<br>
                    Each paddle stroke follows the curve from reach to loss.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    calls the sun from a fishing boat with a pale, yellow sail.<br>
                    We fly by on our return, over the net of eternity thrown out for stars.
                </li>
        <br>  
                <li>
                    scrapes the hull of my soul.
                </li>
                
        <br>
        <br>
            Ah, ah.
    </p>
