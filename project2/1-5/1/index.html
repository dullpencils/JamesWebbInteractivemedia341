        Ah, Ah<br>
        BY JOY HARJO<br>
        <br>
            <em>for Lurline McGregor</em>
        <br>
        <br>
            Ah, <br>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ah <br>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  cries the crow arching toward the heavy sky over the marina.<br>
            Lands on the crown of the palm tree.
        <br>
        <br>
            Ah, <br>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  ah <br>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  slaps the urgent cove of ocean swimming through the slips.<br>
            We carry canoes to the edge of the salt.
        <br>
        <br>
            Ah,<br>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ah <br>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; groans the crew with the weight, the winds cutting skin.<br>
            We claim our seats. Pelicans perch in the draft for fish.
        <br>
        <br>
            Ah, <br>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ah <br>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; beats our lungs and we are racing into the waves.<br>
            Though there are worlds below us and above us, we are straight ahead.
        <br>
        <br>
            Ah,<br>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ah <br> 
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; tattoos the engines of your plane against the skyâ€”away from these waters.<br>
            Each paddle stroke follows the curve from reach to loss.
        <br>
        <br>
            Ah,<br>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ah <br>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; calls the sun from a fishing boat with a pale, yellow sail. 
            <br> We fly by on our return, over the net of eternity thrown out for stars.
        <br>
        <br>
            Ah,<br>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;ah <br>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; scrapes the hull of my soul.<br>
            Ah, <br>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;ah.
